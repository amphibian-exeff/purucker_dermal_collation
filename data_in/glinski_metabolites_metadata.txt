exposure_experiment.csv and microsome_experiment3.csv were used 


exposure_experiment.csv: 
time		- length of time that amphibian was exposed to that pesticide in hours.  
parent		- is the active ingredient that the amphibian was exposed to.  
analyte		- either the main parent compound or the metabolite that was quantified.  
matrix		- the sample that was analyzed either the amphibian or soil.  
conc		- is the concentration for that specific analyte in that matrix for that specific species in microg/g
replicate	- is the individual amphibian or soil exposed to that pesticide.

microsome_experiment3.csv:  
time		- is the length of time that the microsomes were exposed before being quenched in minutes.  
parent		- is the active ingredient that the amphibian was exposed to.  
analyte		- either the main parent compound or the metabolite that was quantified.  
matrix		- the sample that was analyzed microsomes.  
conc		- is the concentration for that specific analyte in that matrix for that specific species.  in micromolar (uM)
replicate	- is the individual microsome exposed to that pesticide. 
microMexp	- is the concentration in micromolar (uM) that the microsomes were exposed to for that pesticide.
