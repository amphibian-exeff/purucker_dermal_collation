**Introduction**
========================================================

The purpose of this script is to combine the data sets from Van Meter et al. (2014, 2015, 2016, 2018), Glinski (2018a, b, c, 2019), and Henson-Ramsey (2008) to create a collated database of amphibian dermal exposure data.

**Data from Relevant Studies**
========================================================
### Van Meter et al. 2014 and Van Meter et al. 2015

Van Meter et al. 2014 performed exposures for 5 pesticide active ingredients (imidacloprid, pendimethalin, atrazine, fipronil, tridimefon) and 7 species (Southern leopard frog (*Lithobates sphenocephala*), Fowler's toad (*Anaxyrus fowleri*), gray treefrog (*Hyla versicolor*), Northern cricket frog (*Acris crepitans*), Eastern narrowmouth toad (*Gastrophryne carolinensis*), barking treefrog (*Hyla gratiosa*) and green treefrog (*Hyla cinerea*)). Whole body tissue concentrations were measured after an 8 hour exposure period to contaminated soil. Pesticides were applied at the maximum legally allowable application rates scaled down to the size of a 10-gallon aquarium.

Van Meter et al. 2015 contrasted two pesticide exposure scenarios: direct exposure through aerial overspray and indirect exposure through soil.  These scenarios tested the same 5 pesticide active ingredients and two of the species (barking treefrog (*Hyla gratiosa*) and green treefrog (*Hyla cinerea*)). Pesticides were applied at the maxium legally allowable application rates scaled down to the size of a 10-gallon aquarium, with the exception of pedimethalin which was applied at 30% of the permitted application rate. This was due to pedimethalin's insolubility in the limited solvent and the water volumes used in this study.

For our purposes, the Van Meter et al. 2015 essentially adds the aerial overspray exposures to the Van Meter et al. 2014 data set.

### Van Meter et al. 2016

Van Meter et al. 2016 considered bioconcentration of 5 current-use pesticides (imidacloprid, atrazine, triadimefon, fipronil, and pedimethalin) in American toads (*Bufo americanus*) across soil types. Toads were exposed to one of two soil types with significantly different organic matter content (14.1% = high organic matter, 3.1% = low organic matter). Whole body tissue concentrations were measured after an 8 hour exposure period to contaminated soil. Pesticides were applied at the maximum legally allowable application rates scaled down to the size of a 0.94 L Pyrex glass bowl.

### Glinski et al. 2018a (Dehydration)

Glinski et al. 2018a studied how amphibian hydration status influences uptake of pesticides through dermal exposure. Amphibians (Southern leopard frogs (*Lithobates sphenocephala*) and Fowler's toads (*Anaxyrus fowleri*)) were dehyrated for periods of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 hours prior to exposure to pesticide-contaminated soils. Pesticides studied included atrazine, triadimefon, metolachlor, chlorothalonil, and imidacloprid. Soil and whole-body homogenates were measured after an 8 hour exposure period. Pesticides were applied at the maximum legally allowable application rates scaled down to the area of six bowls at 1350 cm^2^ (each bowl 15 cm x 15 cm).

### Henson-Ramsey 2008  

Henson-Ramsey 2008 tested the biological impact of exposure to malathion for tiger salamanders (*Ambystoma tigrinum*). Tiger salamanders were exposed to contaminated soils with 50 ug/cm^2^ or 100 ug/cm^2^ malathion and through ingestion of an earthworm exposed to contaminated soils with 200 ug/cm^2^ malathion. For each exposure, the malathion application rate was sprayed onto the approximately 1200g of soil in the 1060cm^2^ polyethylene cages. Tissue concentrations were assessed for five treatment groups: unexposed, exposed to 50 ug/cm^2^ contaminated soil for 1 day, exposed to 50 ug/cm^2^ for 2 days, exposed to 50 ug/cm^2^ contaminated soil for 2 days and fed a contaminated worm on the first exposure day, and exposed to 100 ug/cm^2^ contaminated soil for 2 days and fed a contaminated worm on the first exposure day.

### Glinski et al. 2018b (Metabolites)

Glinski et al. 2018b assessed the potential metabolic activation of pesticides (atrazine, triadimefon, fopronil) in amphibians.  This data set (1) contains *in vitro* and *in vivo* metabolic rate constants derived from toad (*Anaxyrus terrestris*) livers during experiments measuring the depletion of pesticides and the formation of their metabolites. Pesticides were applied at the maximum legally allowable application rates scaled down to the size of a 10-gallon aquarium.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# import data from Glinski 2017 metabolite study
dag2016_metabolite_file <- paste(amphibdir_data_in,"dag2016_data_metabolites.csv", sep="")

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dim(dag2016_metabolite0)
colnames(dag2016_metabolite0)

```

The *in vitro* derived constants were assessed for their precitability by exposing Fowler's toads (*Anaxyrus fowleri*) to contaminated soils at maximum application rate for 2, 4, 12, and 48 hours. This data set (merged) contains the data from the Fowler's toad experiment along with the tissue concentrations from data set 1; this data set is used in subsequent steps.

```


### Glinski et al. 2018c (Biomarkers)

Glinski et al. 2018c exposed Southern leopard frogs (*Lithobates sphenocephala*) to either the maximum or 1/10th maximum pesticide application rate to single, double, or triple pesticide mixtures of bifenthrin, metolachlor, and triadimefon to consider the typical co-application of pesticides during agricultural growing seasons. Tissue concentrations and metabolomic profiling of amphibian livers were studied after an 8 hour exposure period to pesticide-contaminated soil. 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# import data from Glinski 2018 biomarkers study
dag2018_biomarkers_file <- paste(amphibdir_data_in,"dag2018_data_biomarkers.csv", sep="")

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dim(dag2018_mbiomarker0)
colnames(dag2018_mbiomarker0)
summary(dag2018_mbiomarker0)
```

### Van Meter et al. 2018 (Multiple Pesticides Study)

Van Meter et al. 2018 evaluated risks to amphibians after exposure to a single pesticide and pesticide mixtures. The five pesticides studied were three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor, and 2,4-D), one insecticide (malathion), and one fungicide (propiconazole). Juvenile green frogs (*Lithobates clamitans*) were exposed to contaminated soils for 8 hours and metabolic analysis of amphibian livers was conducted to measure the effects. Pesticides were applied at the maximum legally allowable application rates individually and in mixtures of two or three pesticides within an herbicide or mixed pesticide group, scaled down to the size of a 0.94 L Pyrex glass bowl.

Two data sets were generated from this study, one containing data for exposure to herbicides (single and mixed) and the other containing data for exposure to mixed pesticide treatments (herbicides, insecticide, fungicide).
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# import data from Van Meter 2017 herbs
rvm2017_herbs_file <- paste(amphibdir_data_in,"vm2017_herbs.csv", sep="")
file.exists(rvm2017_herbs_file)
rvm2017_herbs0 <- read.table(rvm2017_herbs_file, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```
#### **Herbicide Data Set**
**Data Set Dimensions, Column Names, and Summary:**
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dim(rvm2017_herbs0)
colnames(rvm2017_herbs0)

```
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# import data from Van Meter 2017 hif
rvm2017_hif_file <- paste(amphibdir_data_in,"vm2017_hif.csv", sep="")
file.exists(rvm2017_hif_file)
rvm2017_hif0 <- read.table(rvm2017_hif_file, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```
#### **Mixed Pesticide Data Set**

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dim(rvm2017_hif0)
colnames(rvm2017_hif0)
summary(rvm2017_hif0)
```


The herbicide and mixed pesticide data sets were cleaned and joined into a merged data set (referred to as Van Meter et al. 2018 Multiple Pesticides Study in subsequent steps). The single and mixed-pesticide treatments that were retained in the merged data set included the chemicals atrazine, propiconazole, 2,4-D, malathion, and metolachlor.  Original columns from the herbicide and mixed pesticide data sets were altered for standardization. These standardized columns will be used in future data cleaning steps in order to merge all data sets.

```


***  

**Cleaning and Merging the Data Sets**
=============================================================
Each of the data sets were cleaned for merging. This consisted of dropping unneeded columns and standardizing column names of retained columns.  Four columns were added to all data sets (soil type, formulation, exposure duration, and research study source).  
Once each data set was cleaned, a local copy was saved and the data set was merged with the previously cleaned data sets.

There were 60 observations with atrazine, fipronil, or triadimefon that were dropped because they do not include metabolites in total.

### Glinski et al. 2019 (dermal routes)

~~~ Note: still need to update the application rate column and drop any unneeded pesticides (chemicals column) ~~~~~~  

The dermal routes data set did not include the body weights for the measured amphibians. These weights were included in a separate data set:

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
## import dermal routes data, with amphibians weights
weights_file <- paste(amphibdir_data_in, "Dermal_routes_weights.csv", sep = "")
file.exists(weights_file)
weights <- read.table(weights_file, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```
**Data Set Dimensions, Column Names, and Summary:**
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
dim(weights)
names(weights)
summary(weights)
```

A one-to-many merge was employed to merge the dermal routes data set and the weights data set based on the Sample ID. Only rows where the Matrix is "Amphibian" have a body weight; all other rows are NA. 
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
# merge (one-to-many) dermal routes data with weights data, based on Sample ID
dermal_routes_subset2 <- dermal_routes[order(dermal_routes$Sample.ID), ]
weights_2 <- weights[order(weights$Sample),]

dermal_routes_subset3 <- merge(dermal_routes_subset2, weights_2, 
                               by.x = "Sample.ID", by.y = "Sample", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)
```
The updated dimensions are:
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
dim(dermal_routes_subset3)
```
The soil concentrations, where the Media and Matrix are both "Soil," was subset from the data set to be used later in the data cleaning process. These soil concentrations (currently listed in the "Concentration" column) will be used for the soil_conc_ugg column in the cleaned data set.
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
# subset soil to be used later for soil concentration column (will use "Concentration" column)
soil_subset <- dermal_routes_subset2[dermal_routes_subset2$Media == "Soil", ]
soil_subset2 <- soil_subset[soil_subset$Matrix == "Soil",]
```
The dimensions of this soil subset are:
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
dim(soil_subset2)
```

Referring back to the main dermal routes data set: we are only interested in the pesticide exposures on amphibians while in soil. These rows were subset.
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
#  want Media == soil because interested in dermal exposure in soil
dermal_routes_subset4 <- dermal_routes_subset3[dermal_routes_subset3$Media == "Soil",]
#sum(dermal_routes_subset3$Media == "Soil") # == 96
#dim(dermal_routes_subset4) # == 96 x 6

#  want Matrix == Amphibian because interested in amphib exposure
dermal_routes_subset5 <- dermal_routes_subset4[dermal_routes_subset4$Matrix == "Amphibian", ]
#sum(dermal_routes_subset4$Matrix == "Amphibian") # == 48
#dim(dermal_routes_subset5) # == 48 x 6
```
The updated dimensions are:
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
dim(dermal_routes_subset5)
```

The soil concentrations were appended to the main dermal routes data set.
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
# add in soil concentration column, previously subset
# order by Sample.ID, then by Analyte name to match up rows for the two data sets
dermal_routes_subset6 <- dermal_routes_subset5[order(dermal_routes_subset5[,1], 
                                                     dermal_routes_subset5[,2]),]
soil_subset3 <- soil_subset2[order(soil_subset2[,1], soil_subset2[,2]),]

#dim(dermal_routes_subset6) # == 48 x 6
#dim(soil_subset3) # == 48 x 5

dermal_routes_subset7 <- cbind(dermal_routes_subset6, soil_subset3$Concentration)
```
The updated dimensions are:
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
dim(dermal_routes_subset7)
```

Several new columns (application rate, application, exposure duration, formulation, soil type, source and species) were created and the necessary values were filled in for each column. Existing columns were standardized according to the naming conventions of the collated data set, and unneeded columns were dropped.
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = FALSE}

The columns were ordered for ease of merging with the collated data set, a local copy was saved, and the data set was combined with the collated data set.
